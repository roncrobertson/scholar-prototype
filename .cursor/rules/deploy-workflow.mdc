# Deploy: Commit to Git

When the user says any of:
- "Commit to git"
- "Push to git"
- "Deploy updates"
- "Push my changes"

Run these commands in order:
1. `git add .`
2. `git status` (to show what will be committed)
3. `git commit -m "Update prototype"` — or ask for a message if they prefer something specific
4. `git push origin main`

Vercel auto-deploys on push — no further action needed. Tell the user when the push completes and that the live site will update in 1–2 minutes.
